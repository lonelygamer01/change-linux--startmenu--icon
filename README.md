Make a folder anywhere in your system, then place some svg-s (from experience linux likes mostly monochrome pictures) and this bash script in it.

Make the script executable with chmod +x change-start-icon.sh

Then simply run it in termial, pick which svg You would like to set then hit enter.

It will update the cache data, after few minutes the new icon will appear. For faster change You can log out from the session and log back in to see the result.

The original svg icon is in this repo as well you can place it back if you need it in the:

/usr/share/icons/Yaru/scalable/actions (Yaru is the theme there can be many others)

In the actions folder view-app-grid-symbolic.svg the file you need.
